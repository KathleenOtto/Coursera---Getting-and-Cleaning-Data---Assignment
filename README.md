# Coursera---Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Assignment

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The codebook will describe  
- the data source,  
- the analysis steps taken in the "run_analysis.R" program 
- the variables used in the data

"run_analysis.R" is the program used to tidy up the data.

"averages_tidy.txt" is the text file result from the program.
